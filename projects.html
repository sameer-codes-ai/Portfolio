        After joining VIT in july 2024, I got an opportunity to participate in DevJams, a 48 hr hackathon conducted by Google Developrs Student Clubs [GDSC], VIT Vellore.

                As part of Team a DecentralizedDreamers, we developed a Java-based game called Cryptic Bird - an innovative spin on the classic Flappy Bird, but with added challenges like dynamic levels, moving pipes, spiked pipes, and changing backgrounds. The game integrated Blockchain technology, allowing players to enter their name and BSC blockchain address via Java Swing textboxes. Based on their score, players were rewarded with our custom DevJams Token, coded in Solidity, sent manually to their blockchain wallet after cross verification of score. We stored the player data in a .txt file and used the BEP20 token standard for crypto transactions. My first hackathon was an incredible experience!!
