            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello World! I’m Sameer Kumar, a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore. My coding journey began at age 12, when I first explored programming through QBasic, followed by HTML and Java in middle school. Since then, my passion for problem-solving and building impactful solutions has only grown stronger.
                I completed my schooling at St. Paul’s High School and Don Bosco Academy, Patna, both affiliated with CISCE, where I consistently earned academic merit awards and actively participated in competitions such as the National Science Olympiad (NSO) and International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), securing commendable ranks. These experiences built the foundation for my analytical and collaborative skills.
                At VIT, I’ve expanded my technical and teamwork abilities through multiple projects, hackathons, and volunteering opportunities.
                I’m deeply passionate about AI/ML, competitive programming, and scalable tech for real-world impact, and I’m continuously working on improving my problem-solving, collaboration, and leadership skills.

            <h3>LeetFlix <a href="https://github.com/sameer-codes-ai/LeetFlix" target="_blank">[Github Link]</a></h3>
            <p>
                As part of Team CodeForSurvival, I developed LeetFlix, a Netflix & LeetCode-inspired platform
                featuring a curated library of WebSeries Trivia, offering users a clean, binge-worthy Ul to practice
                engaging trivia challenges.
            
                Engineered the full frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, replicating a Netflix-style UX with
                responsive cards, hover interactions, and category-based trivia browsing.
                Built key features including a discussion forum, leaderboard, and a powerful Admin Panel that allows
                adding new shows or trivia questions with a single JSON paste (auto-parsing questions, options, and
                answers).
           
                Developed a complete backend using Node.js and MongoDB, handling authentication, user progress,
                leaderboard logic, and dynamic content management.
            </p>
            <h3>Cryptic Bird <a href="https://github.com/sameer-codes-ai/DecentralisedDreamers" target="_blank">[Github Link]</a></h3>
            <p>
                As part of Team DecentralizedDreamers, I developed a Java-based game called Cryptic Bird - an
                innovative spin on the classic Flappy Bird, but with added challenges like dynamic levels, moving
                pipes, spiked pipes, and changing backgrounds.
                
                The game integrated Blockchain technology, allowing players to enter their name and BSC blockchain
                address via Java Swing textboxes. Based on their score, players were rewarded with our custom
                DevJams Token, coded in Solidity, sent manually to their blockchain wallet after cross verification of
                score.
                
                We stored the player data in a .txt file and used the BEP20 token standard for crypto transactions.
