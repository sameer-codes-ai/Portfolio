        Hello world, I'm Sameer Kumar from Patna, India. 
        I did my schooling from St Paul's High School, Patna, affiliated to CISCE, New Delhi.. 
        Here I was introduced to Computer Science, where 12y/o me discovered the wonders of programming through QBasic 
        and later, HTML basics and JAVA in grade 7th and 8th respectively. 
        After completing matriculation, I joined Don Bosco Academy, Patna, affiliated to CISCE, New Delhi, for Intermediate.
        Here I improved my coding and collaborative problem solving skills. The level of questions improved and so did my solving approach. 
        Here I participated in National Science Olympiad(NSO) and International Mathematics Olympiad(IMO) conducted by Science Olympiad Foundation(SOF), and and cleared NSO and IMO twice and once respectively with good ranks. 
        I've got academic merit awards in every academic year till date from grade 1 and counting, whose credit goes to my teachers and my never-ending hunger for learning new things. 
        Presently, I'm pursuing B-Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from VIT, Vellore. I'm ready to give my best in this field to forfeit what future holds for me.

        Although the Stuffs that I can add to my portfolio can include my credit card number, CVV, csgo and valo rank, leetcode/codechef rank or any other achievement I want!
        But I'm yet to achieve these things.. May add them in future when i've achieved them..
